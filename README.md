# UofGuelph Arboretum Nature Preserve Wetland - Fall 2024 GEOG*6610 Project
Included in this repository is the data used to calculate a water budget for the swamp in the University of Guelph Arboretum nature preserve.
Derived sensor depth is was calculated using the recorded atmospheric and barometric pressure values from HOBO Onset loggers.

Daily potential evapotranspiration (PET) was calculated using the Hargreaves-Samani equation/method (see project report for more details). 
Temperature data used for PET calculations was downloaded from the Environment and Climate Change Canada Historical Climate Data repository (https://climate.weather.gc.ca/) for the Guelph Turfgrass Institute station.
